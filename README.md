# Tic Tac Toe Implementation

This is a React implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. This game has been
created for a technical task required by Matillion.

## Implementation

The game has been implemented using pure React. With hooks and context being used to 
manage state of the game. CSS modules have been used for styling.

Unit tests have been added to cover component and non-component code.

## Differences from base clone

I've updated CRA and added a few other other utility libraries and typings.
